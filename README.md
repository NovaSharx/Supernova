# SUPER NOVA

Super Nova is a hand eye coordination focused arcade game.

  
  

## GAMEPLAY

The **objective** of the game is to hit the most amount of falling **Disks** as accurately as possible with either the '***A***', '***S***' or '***D***' key. Those keys are your **Detonators**.

  

### Timer

There will be a time limit of ***100*** seconds.

  

> So make every second count!

  

### Score

You will be rewarded various **Score Points** for each hit based off of timing and accuracy.

  

### Gravity Level

Your **Gravity Level** determines how quickly the disks spawn and fall. As you hit disks, you will be rewarded **Skill Rating Points** behind the scenes which contribute towards promoting your gravity level. If you miss **Disks** or allow them to pass by then you will lose skill rating and possibly demote your gravity level. The highest gravity level achievable is ***10***.

  List item

### Streak Count

You can grow a **Streak Count** for hitting multiple **Disks** in a row without missing.

  

### Score Multiplier

You have a **Score Multiplier** which can double, triple or even quadruple the amount of **Score Points** you earn for each hit. The higher your **Streak Count**, the more your score multiplier grows with ***x4*** being the max.

  

### Missing A Disk

If you happen to miss a **Disk** or trigger an empty **Detonator** then your **Streak Count** and **Score Multiplier** bonus will both reset. Build it back up to earn as many **Score Points** as possible.

  

### Power Bar Bonus Mode

Hitting an **Accuracy Rating** of '***Perfect***' or '***Super Perfect***' grants you **Power Bar** points for it's respective column up to 100 points. Once you hit the cap your power bar will start to shrink and will spawn special 'Bonus Disks'. Hitting a Bonus Disk grants you 300 points regardless of accuracy (That's triple the max of a regular disk). They do not grant power bar points.
